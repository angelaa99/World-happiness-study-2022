# Worldwide Happiness Study 2022

## Description
In this project, I am looking into 2022 [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/) commissioned by United Nations, which contains global happiness index and a series of social-economic factors such as `economy`, `health`, `freedom`, `social support`, `corruption` and `generosity`. First thing I noticed is countries rank higher on each variables tend to be happier. So after some data cleaning, I looked into how countries in each continents are doing in terms of their social-economic well-being.
